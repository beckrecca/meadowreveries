          <p>
            Needle felting is the craft of sculpting or painting wool using a special barbed needle. 
            Felting needles feature tiny, microscopic barbs that catch the fibers and cause the fibers to tangle together with each poke. 
            The more you poke a felting needle into wool, the more matted and denser it becomes. 
            It's like the opposite of combing your hair. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Wool fiber is soft, flexible, and layerable. 
            As a crafting material, felting wool fiber is both forgiving and obedient. 
            It's perfect for beginners, relaxing and meditative.

          <p>Anything you can daydream, you can needle felt.</p>
