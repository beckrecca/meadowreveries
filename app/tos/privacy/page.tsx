Our cloud service provider Digital Ocean has <a href="https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/regional-availability/" target="_blank">servers located globally</a>. If you are accessing our Services from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see "WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE
      SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?" above), in and other countries.
      If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EA), United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal
      information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.</p>

      <h2>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
      <p>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law. <br/>
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

      <h2>DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
      <p>In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age. <br/>

You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at <strong>hello@meadowreveries.com</strong>.
      However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

      <h3>Account Information</h3>

      applicable legal requirements.</p>

      <h2>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
      <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
      mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

      <h2>DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
      <p>In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws. <br/>
      We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date at the top of this privacy
      notice. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly
      sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
